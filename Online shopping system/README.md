# Online Shopping System Overview

An Online Shopping System is a web-based platform that allows customers to browse and purchase products or services via the internet. It facilitates various stages of the purchasing process, from selecting items to making payments and managing orders. The system typically includes a catalog of products, a shopping cart mechanism, user accounts, payment gateways, and integration with delivery or logistics services.

## Key Components of an Online Shopping System

1. **User Interface (UI)**: 
   - The front end of the system, where users (customers) interact with the platform.
   - Features for browsing products, filtering items, viewing details, and managing their cart.

2. **Product Catalog**: 
   - A database that stores information about the available products or services.
   - Includes details like price, descriptions, images, stock availability, and categories.

3. **Shopping Cart**: 
   - Allows customers to temporarily save items they wish to purchase.
   - Tracks quantities, prices, and other purchase details before checkout.

4. **Payment Gateway**: 
   - Secure integration with third-party payment services (e.g., credit cards, PayPal).
   - Handles transaction and verification of payment information.

5. **Order Management**: 
   - Processes orders after the customer completes the purchase.
   - Includes features for tracking order status, managing shipping and delivery, and handling returns or cancellations.

6. **Authentication & User Accounts**: 
   - Customers may register, log in, and maintain accounts to view purchase history and manage profile information.

7. **Admin Panel**: 
   - For system administrators and vendors, allowing management of product listings, order fulfillment, user accounts, and analytics.

## Principles Implemented in an Online Shopping System
